CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.6
------------------------
    o New function `getWorkflowConfig` is added and the output from this
    function is now required as an input for the `config` argument of 
    `currentInput`, `udpateInput`, and `runWorkflow` functions.
    This change makes the execution of different functions faster because they
    don't need to access AnVIL everytime to get the configuration.
    o New function `AnVILBrowse` is added

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------
    o Initial release of the 'AnVILWorkflow' package
